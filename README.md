# DBConnectionManager-SQL-Java
A Class for Managing Connections from Java Code to a SQL Database

You must include a JDBC driver. I used mysql-connector-java. It was version 8.0.16.

This class lets you connect to and diconnect from a sql databse (currently only MySQL) without managing manually managing the connection String.

For the connection, you can set:

Just the username

The password too

The host and port also
